# ANGULAR CHANGE DETECTION USING OBJECT TRACKING (CAM SHIFT)
#Object tracking using CAM shift and histogram back projection algorithm
Histogram back projection algorithm is sensitive to noise and continous change in color. It works effectively on objects having uniform foreground and backgound. It computes histogram of selected ROI on current frame which will be back project on next frame to calculate ROI.  
#
CAM shift algorithm tracks points of Region of interest where size of the bounded box varies dynamically.
